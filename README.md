# WAZEN
**WAZEN** is an Arabic NLP text utility to find word variation pattern.
In this work three supervised machine learning algorithms were trained and validated on a 20k labeled words in order to detect the variation pattern of a given word which is a basic operation that is needed for NLP text in Arabic and about 96% accuracy was recorded.

And we are using the final models to develop an application that gives the root of the word based on the variation pattern.
```
Ex:
 -Input: مكالمة
 -Word variation pattern-مفاعلة :-الوزن الصرفي
 -Root-كلم :-الجذر
```
